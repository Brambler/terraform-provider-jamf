package jamf

// Jamf does not have official documentation on how to upload an actual package file
// via the API. Therefore I'm not including this by default. If anyone wants to submit
// a PR to enable this "aftermarket" functionality based on JSSImporter or other third
// party packages, then please do.

// Plz help Jamf, you're our only hope
